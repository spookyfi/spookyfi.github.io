                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">An improved interface for serious traders has been a development priority since Spooky’s launch, and we’re proud to reveal the latest upgrade for the advanced swap interface. SpookySwap is officially announcing that our expert trading page has been rebuilt and is now live!
<br>
<br>Through our partnership with Cryptokek, the Fantom Opera network has access to a high quality, fast, ad-free charting dApp which covers over 99% of the tokens on Spooky. That means any chain on this list can be quickly supported for future charts. The Cryptokek dApp as it now stands tracks several networks, with
<br>Fantom Foundation
<br>’s Fantom Opera network being the newest. Kek allows you to easily analyze markets via TradingView charts, recent trades, market summary, trending tokens, and keep a list of your favorite tokens. There are plenty new features the Cryptokek team is actively working to integrate to make Kek the number one utility for charts and analytics.
<br>The familiar Expert Trader page, now v2!
<br>
<br>Thanks to our hardworking development team, Spooky can now show our improved custom interface upgrades which combines cryptokek’s charts with information directly from the Spooky swap page. These improved tools include revamping personal trade history, a history of liquidity changes for LP pairs, limit order history, and our familiar swap user interface. A major improvement is now across the Spooky site and all panels, US dollar amount will be shown when doing transactions.
<br>
<br>Let’s break down each of the major new additions to the Spooky expert trader swap page:
<br>Your watch list will be displayed directly underneath the navigation bar
<br>LP pair watch list is a new feature for our expert page
<br>
<br>Our expert trader watch list is now live, with tokens searchable by either a whitelisted name or their address. Your favorite LP pairs will be displayed conveniently in the expert trader bar near the top of the Spooky webpage. See 24 hour price changes of each pair and click them to quickly change between charts of different tokens.
<br>Adding USDC or FTM based LP pairs is easily done with a convenient toggle
<br>While Trade History looks similar, it is now infinitely scrollable for all blockchain history
<br>
<br>The Trade History panel will display an animation while updating with new transactions right as they happen, and features infinite scrolling. When scrolling to the bottom of the panel more transactions will continue to load to see all history for the LP pair.
<br>Market and Limit Orders will now be displayed in the same Order History panel
<br>
<br>Order history is now scrollable to show all order history available on-chain, and will combine limit and market orders in the same history panel. You can easily switch between open limit orders and executed orders at the top of the panel.
<br>
<br>By integrating these features into the SpookySwap swap page, we expect our updated expert trading mode to improve the serious trader experience and bring more investors onto Fantom Opera and experience the lowest fees and fastest transactions, now with improved charting tools to make informed and optimized swap and limit orders. We welcome feedback on our updated user interface and layout in either our community-ran Telegram group, or our Discord server.</p>
